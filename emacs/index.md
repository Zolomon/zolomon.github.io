3. [Projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile), working with files in projects
4. [Popwin](https://github.com/m2ym/popwin-el), use popups instead of buffers
5. [switch-window](https://github.com/dimitri/switch-window), choose buffers by number
6. [Hyde](https://github.com/nibrahim/Hyde), working with Jekyll
7. [Auto-fill-mode][auto-fill-mode]: Automatically insert whitespace at `(fill-column)` set by `C-x f`.
