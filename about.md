"Zolomon")

Bengt "Zolomon" Ericsson is my name, at the moment of
writing I'm 28 years old.
Currently working as a software developer while finish a M.Sc. in
Computer Science, have a few courses left in mathematics to grind off
before my thesis.

Areas that I dedicate a few hours each month go into Artificial
Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Graphics, Game Development
and general Software Development.

In the footer of this blog you can find some contact information of mine.
