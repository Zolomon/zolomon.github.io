# Two monks
> Two monks were on a pilgrimage. One day, they came to a deep river. At
> the edge of the river, a young woman sat weeping, because she was
> afraid to cross the river without help. She begged the two monks to
> help her. The younger monk turned his back. The members of their order
> were forbidden to touch a woman.
>
> But the older monk picked up the woman without a word and carried her
> across the river. He put her down on the far side and continued his
> journey. The younger monk came after him, scolding him and berating
> him for breaking his vows. He went on this way for a long time.
>
> Finally, at the end of the day the older monk turned to the younger
> one. "I only carried her across the river. You have been carrying her
> all day."
