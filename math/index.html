<h4>1. Simple exercise in probability</h4>

<p>
What is approximately $P(\overline{X} < 30)$, where the average of $25$
independent random variables, all of which share the same distribution with the
expected value of $31$ and the variance $34$?
</p>
<p>
Answer with two ($2$) decimals.
</p>

<h4>1. Solution</h4>
<p>
    A little experience is necessary to understand how to solve this problem.
</p>
<p>
    There is a theorem called the "Central Limit Theorem" (CLT) which will provide
    us with the necessary tools.
</p>
<p>
    The definition is:
</p>
<p>
    $$ Y_{\text{n}} = X_{\text{1}} + X_{\text{2}} + ... + X_{\text{n}}, $$
    $$ Z = \frac{Y_{\text{n}} - n\mu}{\sigma\sqrt{n}},$$
    $$ \lim_{x\to\infty} P(a < Z \leq b) =
    \Phi(b) - \Phi(a). $$
</p>
<p>
    Where $\Phi(x)$ is the density function for $N(\mu, \sigma)$, $\mu$ is the expected
    value, $\sigma$ the standard deviation, and $n$ the number of random variables.
</p>
<p>
    So, if $n$ is large enough, we can assume that the above formula holds, meaning that
    the probability for the $Z$ to be within the bounds of $a$ and $b$, will be the
    same as calculating the difference between the density function for each of the
    $\text{z-scores}$.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>(I'm tired, and will stop being so rigorous. :( )</strong>
</p>

<p>
    If we let $X_{\text{i}}$, $i = 1, 2, ..., n = 25$ be the value for the
    random variable $i$ and the average of these be represented by $\overline{X}
    = \frac{X_{\text{1}} + X_{\text{2}} + ... + X_{\text{25}}}{25}$, then
    $\overline{X}$ has a normal distribution, $\overline{X} \in
    N(E(\overline{X}), D(\overline{X}))$.
</p>
<p>    
    This is because it's a linear function of random variables with the same
    distribution and $CLT$ states that these will have a normal distribution if
    $n$ is large enough.
</p>

<p>
    With,
    $$
    E(X_{\text{i}}) = \mu = 31,
    $$

    $$
    V(X_{\text{i}}) = \sigma^{2} = 34,
    $$

    $$
    D(X_{\text{i}}) = \sigma = \sqrt{34} = 5.83,
    $$
</p>
<p>
    $E(\overline{X})$ and $D(\overline{X})$ then becomes:
</p>

<p>
    $$
    E(\overline{X}) = E(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{\text{i}}) =
    \frac{1}{n} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{n}E(X_{\text{i}}) =
    \frac{1}{n} \cdot n \cdot E(X_{\text{i}}) = E(X_{\text{i}}) = \mu = 31,
    $$

    $$
    V(\overline{X}) = V(\frac{1}{n^{2}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{\text{i}}) =
    \frac{1}{n^{2}} \sum_{i=1}^{n}V(X_{\text{i}}) = \frac{1}{n^{2}} \cdot n
    \cdot V(X_{\text{i}}) = \frac{V(X_{\text{i}})}{n} = \frac{34}{25} = 1.36,
    $$

    $$
    D(\overline{X}) = \sqrt{V(\overline{X})} \approx 1.16619
    $$
</p>
<p>
    The probability we are looking for then becomes:
    $$
    P(\overline{X} < 30) = \Phi(\frac{X - E(\overline{X})}{D(\overline{X})})
    = \Phi(\frac{30 - 31}{1.16619}) = \Phi(-0.8574) = 1 - \Phi(0.8574)$$
    
    $$
    = \text{[normal dist. table lookup]} = 1 - 0.8023 = 0.1977 \approx 0.20    
    $$
    $$
    \tag*{$\square$}
    $$
