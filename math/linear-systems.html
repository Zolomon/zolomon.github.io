<h4>Linear Systems</h4>

<p>
    $$\text{1.1) Specify the angular frequency, frequency and period for the sinus
    waves:}$$
    $$a)\ u(t) = 3 \sin (2t - 5),$$
    $$b)\  u(t) = 50 \sin (100\pi t + 1).$$
    </p>

<p> To answer a) & b), we just need to remember the constituent parts of the formula for an undampened oscillator, given by: $u(t) =
    A sin(\omega t + \alpha)$.
</p>
<p>
    Here, $A$ is the $\textbf{amplitude}$, $\omega$ is the
    $\textbf{angular frequency}$, and $\alpha$ is the $\textbf{phase}$.

    The frequency and period are defined as:

    $$ \textbf{Period: } T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}, $$

    $$ \textbf{Frequency: } f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{\omega}{2\pi}.$$

    Thus, by looking and substituting the parts from u(t) with the definitions
    for the frequency and period, we receive the following:
    <br />
    <br />
    For a):
    $$ \textbf{Angular frequency} = \omega = 2, $$
    $$ \textbf{Period} = T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = \frac{2\pi}{2} = \pi, $$
    $$ \textbf{Frequency} = f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{\pi}. $$

    <br />
    <br />

    For b)
    $$ \textbf{Angular frequency} = \omega = 100\pi, $$

    $$ \textbf{Period} = T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = \frac{2\pi}{100\pi} =
    \frac{1}{50},
    $$

    $$ \textbf{Frequency} = f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{50}} =
    \frac{1}{1} \cdot \frac{50}{1} = 50.
    $$
