<p>You have probably not heard about the indie game developer competition called <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com">Ludum Dare</a>. It's a rapid game creation community where you compete against each other to complete a game within 48 hours and then rate the games produced during the weekend. After two weeks a winner will be named based on who got the most votes.</p>

<p>The difference, on the 21st occurrence of Ludum Dare, was that the creator of <a href="http://www.minecraft.com">MineCraft</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/notch">@notch</a> (Markus Persson), decided to join the tournament as he's done a few times before. Enter Publicity.</p>
