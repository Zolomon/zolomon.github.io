# Nature of Code

I recently started reading a new book I had found by accident on HN; [Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com). A book about creative coding if you only glance at it. However, look deeper and you have a book that covers, with the help of [Processing.js](http://processing.org), areas that are useful not only to creative coders but also to game developers; basic mathematical constructs, physics and artificial intelligence. 

It begins by explaining coordinate systems, positions and how to create visual animation but stepping through time. Daniel, the author, then continues to build upon this basic foundation by creating abstractions; like two-dimensional vectors and how you can utilize them for your benefit. 

The chapter on forces is incredibly valuable to any game developer or creative coder alike!
