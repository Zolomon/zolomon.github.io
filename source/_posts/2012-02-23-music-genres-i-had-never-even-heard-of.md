# Wikipedia, I Love You
Today while procrastinating from my calculus studies, I found [this short list of electronic music genres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_electronic_music_genres). 

A list of all the music genres I had always dreamed of. Now I have it, and now I have a lot of new material to consume! Yay!

Thank you Wikipedia, this is why I donated 100 SEK to you last year. I will most likely do it again, just for the sake of this list.
