# Ctrl+Paint: How to Draw

A few days ago I received my Wacom Intuos5 Small Touch. My happiness since has reached exponential levels. 
Drawing with it is wonderful, better than on dead trees most of the time. The only annoying part is that 
I can't draw with it while I'm on the bus. 

A friend of mine, [Alexandra](http://www.kulecka.com), showed me [this wonderful site](http://ctrlpaint.com/) with 
great videos to improve your drawing skills, both analog and digital.

Currently I'm on lesson 2 and have improved a lot in a few hours. This is great!
