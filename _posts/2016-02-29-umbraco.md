If a node in Umbraco ever becomes corrupted there are a few ways to fix this issue.

Try the following steps in this order:

1.  Try to republish the node.

2.  Delete the node and manually clear the *[recycle bin](http://localhost:64764/Umbraco#/content/content/recyclebin)*.

3. If the problem persists, open up `~/App_Data/umbraco.sdf` (use the SQl Compact Database Toolkit for Visual Studio) and manually delete all artefacts pertaining the corrupted node.

4. Republish the entire site by visiting [this link](http://localhost:64764/umbraco/#/content), right click on `CONTENT` and then choose `Republish entire site`, which will rebuild `~/App_Data/umbraco.config`.

This _should_ solve your problems, or at least it worked for me!
