Here is a small dump of new features in Emacs that I have assimilated during the day:

# List of new things I learnt today in Emacs:
1. Bookmarks `C-x r l` to list, `C-x r m` to make a new bookmark and `C-x r b` to jump to a bookmark. Both files and directories can be bookmarked.
2. [Neotree](https://github.com/jaypei/emacs-neotree), a tree directory visualizer
3. [Projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile), working with files in projects
4. [Popwin](https://github.com/m2ym/popwin-el), use popups instead of buffers
5. [switch-window](https://github.com/dimitri/switch-window), choose buffers by number
