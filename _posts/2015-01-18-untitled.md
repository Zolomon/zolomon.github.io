Today I have been preparing for an interview that I have tomorrow. Will be interesting to see how it will go.

Went ice-skating yesterday with Martina, that was really fun, but a bit too crowded. I'm hoping that we will go again some time in the future, but then I better borrow a pair of skates that fit and a helmet. Perhaps some pads too.

I learned some new russian words the other day:

*  **Нет** - _no_
*  **Семь** - _seven_
*  **Пять** - _five_
*  **Метро** - _metro_ or _subway_
