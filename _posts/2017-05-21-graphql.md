During this weekend I had a great experience at the [GraphQL Europe Conference](https://graphql-europe.org) in Berlin.

(I will update this post with links to slides and videos when I find them.)

Below is a brief summary of the common decisions, lessons learnt, solutions and thoughts from the speakers at the conference, about how to use GraphQL in production at scale:

* To use GraphQL in a near real-time fashion, the language will need an extension that sends query + subscription at the same time.
* There are different types of queries with trade-offs: [`Static`](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/5-benefits-of-static-graphql-queries-b7fa90b0b69a), `compiled + optimizations`, `whitelisted`, `dynamic`, [`persisted` [1]](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/persisted-graphql-queries-with-apollo-client-119fd7e6bba5)[[2]](https://docs.scaphold.io/tutorials/persisted-queries/).
* You will want to apply instrumentation of queries and only optimize those that data shows are slow.
* Cache queries & results, e.g. HTTP cache headers & client/server-side caching via [`DataLoader`](https://github.com/facebook/dataloader).
* [`N+1 problem`](https://speakerdeck.com/player/6f865a0318c5442f9ee191b4166e48d3?slide=38#) -- and the solution is batching queries. There are tools for this.
* [`Subscriptions` vs `Live Queries`](http://graphql.org/blog/subscriptions-in-graphql-and-relay/) exist with different use-cases, we're interested in [`Subscriptions`](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/#sec-Subscription).
* Use the `Schemas`/`Types`. Nice optimizations can be implemented when relying on the AST for the `Schemas`/`Types`. E.g. Don't have any mutations in a query? Then redirect the underlying query to use the read-only replica DB, otherwise hit the write/read one.
* [`Client-driven development`](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/graphql-at-facebook-by-dan-schafer-38d65ef075af) -- the client (or the User of the thing) sets the constraints and interfaces
* Use Fragments as a first primitive. Look at col(l)ocation.
* [`Optimistic UI`s](https://uxplanet.org/optimistic-1000-34d9eefe4c05).
* `Apollo Optics`: Store data about the query, like SQL statements that were generated.
* Ruby gem to annotate definitions with accepted_scopes // authorization layer on top of resolution.
* Public/Private separation of schemas for dev/production separation.
* Pagination via first/last parameters - perhaps add offset?
* `is`/`has`/`can` prefixes for boolean values
* [Directives], new ones like `@defer`, `@future` are coming.
* Rate limiting/Throttling of queries.
* Use GraphiQL for explorative development.
* [`GraphQL IDL`](https://www.graph.cool/docs/faq/graphql-idl-schema-definition-language-kr84dktnp0/) by [`GRAPHCOOL`](https://graph.cool).
* [`GraphQL Voyager`](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager) - Visual Representation for the Schema.
* [`GraphQL Faker`](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-faker) - mock data.
* [`GraphQL Docs`](https://graphql-docs.com) - generate docs from schemas.
* Think about versioning.
* Useful tools at [`awesome-graphql`](https://github.com/chentsulin/awesome-graphql).

The conference receives several üëç from me. 

Great work, let's hope we get to go next year as well!
