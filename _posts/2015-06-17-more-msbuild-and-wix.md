Spent more time with [MSBuild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSBuild) and [WIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WiX).

Had to use MSBuild Extension Pack to update XML files (which was better than using regex replace).
Use WIX to create `.msi` installation files for the software we create. Would be nice if MSBuild could create these installation packages, but another DSL is apparently necessary. Either way, quite a productive day so far.

Also got Emacs operating smoothly on Windows 7, the 24.5 version was lagging too much but 24.4 seems to be spinning rapdily along.
