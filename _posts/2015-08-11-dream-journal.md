# Dreams
Today on the way to work, roughly 6:50-7:30 AM, the sky was darker than I have
seen it in a long while. For some reason I woke up far too early this morning,
had a strange nightmare; was helping my mother with laundry in some kind of
basement in a place I have never lived in before. Suddenly I found a hole close
to where the floor meets the wall, and it seemed to have been chipped away, from
the outside through the cement. It had a radius of roughly 30 cm. On the other
side of the hole was a parking lot or continuation of the basement.

Felt quite creepy, so I turned around to get out of the laundry room and was met
by my mother's confusion, which turned into horror and terror when she became
aware about the increasing number of spiders in varying shapes and sizes that
appeared. On the long side of the room there were two radiators fixed at the
yellow wall, where I saw spiders, small and large, nesting and crawling out
from cracks in the wall. Felt like spider web was emerging through them at the
same time.

As the panic hit I started to bolt for the exit but was met by a comically large
female spider walking towards the room's entrance from the outside followed by
her myriad of children beneath and between her large legs. We both gave each
other the heebie-jeebies.

I started flailing with my legs above her in a futile attempt to scare her away,
but as with all mothers; they don't like being threatened. So she gave me every
warning sign that she could, unbeknownst to me at the time, and then leapt at me
with all her might. Her eight eyes fixed into mine, she came at me with
incredible furor. And then I woke up.
