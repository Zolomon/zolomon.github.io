On Windows +7 it's possible for a third-party process to modify the keyboard layout list. This is terribly uncomfortable if you're a person like me, who works in multiple layouts.

UnloadKeyboardLayout works quite well, but it's only a temporary fix apparently.
The locales that exist in Control Panel -> Region -> Keyboard Layout are controlled via registry keys, so after reboot the keyboard layouts will be reloaded and thus UnloadKeyboardLayout does not work.

Querying with WQL did not work:
https://gist.github.com/Zolomon/b89025b8c5283acf5ee4 -- unparsable query, why?

RegistryTreeChangeEvent -- might have worked if I got the WQL query to work.

Tried RegistryMonitor, a wrapper around WQL -- did not work for the same reason

RegNotifyChangeKeyValue -- worked

Found a wrapper using PInvoke of RegNotifyChangekeyValue -- splendid

Next step was to work out to find the difference after the change, and then purge it safely.

``` c#
var locales = Registry.CurrentUser.OpenSubKey("Keyboard Layout\\Preload", false);
var valueNames = locales.GetValueNames();
foreach(var name in valueNames) {
    var value = locales.GetValue(name);
    RegistryCleaner.
}
```

Had to create a whitelist, decided on using Settings files for configuration.
Found this list with locale IDs:

Realized that the registry is sorting locales with an index starting from 1.
If you delete one of the registry values in between 1 and n, then the rest of the value names need to be shifted down as well, and I have not tested yet whether this causes any problems.

As an added feature I wanted to report which processes were adding new locales:
